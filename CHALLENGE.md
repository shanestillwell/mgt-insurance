## Node.js Backend Challenge: Insurance Policy Quote Integration

### Scenario:
You work for UTSafe Insurance, a fictitious insurance company in Utha. Your task is to create a backend service that integrates with an external insurance dispatcher API, fetches quotes based on user input, and returns the best three quotes to the front-end.

### Requirements:

#### Setup:
Initialize a new Node.js project using TypeScript.
Set up a PostgreSQL database using your preferred ORM (e.g., TypeORM, Sequelize).

#### API Endpoints:
`/api/quotes`: POST request that takes user details (name, age, car model, years of driving experience) and fetches insurance quotes.
`/api/quotes/best-three`: GET request that retrieves the best three quotes (lowest price) from the previously fetched quotes.

#### Integration:
Integrate with a mocked insurance dispatcher API. Use tools like json-server or MirageJS to mock the external API.

#### Database:
Store all fetched quotes in the PostgreSQL database with relevant user details.

#### Error Handling:
Properly handle potential errors like invalid user input, API failures, etc.

#### Documentation:
Provide a brief README detailing how to set up and run the project.

#### Bonus (not required, but good to have):
- Implement caching to speed up repeated requests.
- Include unit and integration tests.
- Implement a rate-limiting mechanism to avoid overloading the mocked dispatcher API.
- Containerize the application using Docker.
- Use an AWS service, like AWS Lambda, to showcase a serverless deployment.
